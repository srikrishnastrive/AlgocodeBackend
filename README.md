Project: Advanced Microservices-based Code Compilation and Execution Platform like Leetcode or Codeforces
Microservices Architecture & Scalability: Architected an advanced, highly scalable microservices-based platform for code compilation and execution, ensuring seamless scalability and high availability with AWS deployment and auto-scaling capabilities.

Dynamic Problem Administration: Engineered a sophisticated Problem Admin Service using JavaScript, Express, and MongoDB to manage CRUD operations for problems, incorporating complex test cases and code stubs to facilitate comprehensive evaluation.

Advanced Code Execution: Developed a cutting-edge Executor Service in TypeScript and Express, leveraging Docker containers to support multi-language code execution (Java, Python, C++). Employed Strategy and Factory design patterns to optimize execution environments and manage Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) conditions effectively.

High-performance Asynchronous Communication: Designed a robust submission service with Fastify, handling a high volume of requests with exceptional performance. Utilized Redis message queues for efficient asynchronous communication, ensuring seamless integration between submission and executor services. Implemented WebSocket services to provide real-time feedback to users, enhancing interactivity and responsiveness.AWS Deployment & Operational Excellence: 
Deployed the entire system on AWS, utilizing auto-scaling groups, load balancers, and monitoring tools to ensure optimal performance, fault tolerance, and operational excellence
